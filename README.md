# WebMIDIKitDemo

This project is a simple project demonstrating the use of the [WebMIDIKit framework](https://github.com/adamnemecek/WebMIDIKit/). It just sends a second long C8 to a port of the user's choosing. Note that in order for this note to be heard, you have to have something generating sound on the other side of the port.

Check out the link above for further info.

To use, clone the repo, `cd` into the directory and run `swift package update`. Then open the Xcode project.

When building in Xcode, make sure that you have selected the right target.
